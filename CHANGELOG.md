## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-15

### Added
- **Auto-Refreshing Stock Charts**: Stock price charts now automatically refresh every minute to show the latest data
- **Portfolio Valuation Timeline Extension**: Portfolio Total Value Over Time chart now always extends to today's date, not just the last price update
- **Latest Date Annotation**: Portfolio valuation chart displays the most recent date in the top-right corner for easy reference
- **Automatic Market Index Loading**: Market indices (S&P 500, Euro Stoxx 50) are now automatically fetched when uploading transactions
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Added 55+ unit tests across core modules (fetch_prices, fetch_indices, price_fetchers, ticker_resolver, main API endpoints)
- **Test Coverage Reporting**: New invoke tasks for coverage reports (`test-cov`, `test-cov-html`)
- **Test Organization**: Separated unit tests (`test-unit`) from integration tests (`test-integration`) for faster feedback

### Changed
- **Transaction Marker Positioning**: Buy/sell markers now align with candlestick high/low prices instead of transaction prices, fixing alignment issues caused by stock splits
- **Chart Refresh Interval Management**: Each stock chart properly clears previous refresh intervals when switching stocks

### Fixed
- **Portfolio Chart End Date**: Fixed issue where portfolio valuation chart would stop at the last price update instead of extending to today
- **Transaction Marker Alignment**: Fixed misalignment of transaction markers on stocks with splits (e.g., ASML) by positioning markers at actual candlestick prices
- **Chart Auto-Refresh**: Properly manages refresh intervals to prevent memory leaks and duplicate refreshes

### Testing

- **Unit Test Coverage**:
  - main.py: API endpoints and server functionality
  - fetch_indices.py: Market index data fetching
  - fetch_prices.py: Stock price data fetching
  - price_fetchers.py: Price provider implementations
  - ticker_resolver.py: ISIN to ticker mapping

- Enhanced testing section with coverage information and test organization
- Added changelog entry for version 0.3.0

### Fixed

- **ASML Ticker Correction**: Updated ASML ticker from "ASML" (NASDAQ/USD) to "ASML.AS" (Amsterdam/EUR) to match transaction currency
- **Transaction Marker Alignment**: Fixed "floating markers" issue where markers appeared detached from price chart due to currency mismatches
- **Upload Error Handling**: Fixed date/time parsing for DEGIRO transaction files with separate Date and Time columns
